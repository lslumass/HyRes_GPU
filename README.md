# HyRes_GPU model tutorial   
**at2hyres:** convert atomistic model to HyRes model   
**run_OpenMM:** setup and script for running simulation on OpenMM   
**backmap:** rebuild atomistic model from HyRes results   

## Shortly
HyRes model is a **Hy**brid **Res**olution coarse-grained protein model developed since 2017, where the backbone is atomistic-style description but coarse-grained side chains. For a full and complete description of the HyRes model, please move to the related papers as follows:  
1. HyRes: [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2017,19, 32421-32432](https://doi.org/10.1039/C7CP06736D)
2. HyRes-II: [J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2022, 62, 18, 4523–4536](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00974)
3. HyRes-GPU: [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2024, 146, 1, 342–357](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c09195)  

For running a HyRes simulation, two steps are necessary:
1. convert atomistic model to HyRes model, please follow [README.md](https://github.com/wayuer19/HyRes_GPU/blob/main/at2hyres/README.md) in [at2hyres](https://github.com/wayuer19/HyRes_GPU/tree/main/at2hyres) for the step-by-step instructions.  
    Following the instructions, one can create the PDB and PSF files for HyRes model, which will be used as the input files in OpenMM.
   >[!NOTE]
   >For IDPs or simple peptides without folded structures, another option is using [HyresBuilder](https://github.com/wayuer19/HyresBuilder), which can build HyRes model from sequence.        
3. describe HyRes force field in OpenMM and run the simulation.   
   Here, the HyRes force field was fully described through custom forces in OpenMM, which were integrated into the running script. If interested, one can read the script for details.   
   Some parameters needed to be regulated according to the simulation details, like box size, time step, ion concentration, and so on   

After these two steps, HyRes simulation can be run through  
`python run.nvt.py pdb_file psf_file GPU_id`   
details can be found in the folder of [run_OpenMM](https://github.com/wayuer19/HyRes_GPU/tree/main/run_OpenMM).
